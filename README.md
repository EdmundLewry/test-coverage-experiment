# Automated Test Pattern Implementation Library

Hi! Welcome to my repository of Automated Test Implementation Patterns. Here you'll find a codebase (and maybe some documentation) where I explore and isolate various production code scenarios to try to understand what I think are the best practices for implementing automated testing to cover those situations. 

This is mostly a tool for my own understanding, but maybe it can be useful for you too!

## Background
In mid 2021, I was asked to write a presentation exploring Unit Testing and Test Driven Development to give to a group involved in Software Architecture at my job. The aim was to be able to provide enough background for the group to make a decision on how we made use of the practice of unit testing across the different teams in the organisation.

The main feedback I got from the presentation was that it didn't really answer the question of *how* do you write a unit test. How do you select your test data? What is the right level of abstraction for a unit of work?

I'd already done a chunk of reading on Unit Testing to prepare for the presentation, and I'd learnt a lot on top of the experience I'd gained writing automated tests for our codebases in the past. But I wanted to do a better job of filling in that missing piece; moving from the theory of unit tests to the practicality of it. The only problem is I didn't have that knowledge myself! Not categorically. So I've started this Test Pattern Implementation Library where I can isolate and explore the concepts of unit testing in small practical examples. The hope is that it will result in my understanding the practice more clearly, and maybe it'll be useful to someone else in the future!
